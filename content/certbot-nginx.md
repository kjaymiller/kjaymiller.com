title: How to enable certs with CertBot and NGINX

I always forget this so I'm adding it to my website instead of my notes (since I apparently don't check those.[^1])

`sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain -d www.your_domain`

[^1]: I also added it to my archive in Drafts (it was in the inbox with 800 other items)
