Happy to announce that Ask a Brit is back for another round. Jay and Jamie decided to record a bunch of their conversations where Jamie asked about US politics and THE VID.

If we're not professionals and this shows it! I hope you'll enjoy segments from our zany conversations trying to understand the cultures of each of our countries.
