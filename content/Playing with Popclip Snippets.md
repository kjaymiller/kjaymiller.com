Popclip announced a new update that made making snippets much easier.

I took some time to make a couple videos. [the first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch/i4ORaFxbHvg) about the update and shows a pretty simple use case using my project <https://diversityorgs.tech>. The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF8KHV7s3EE) showing that even though they made making snippets easier, you can still do a lot if you know a little scripting.

Also I create a repo of snippets in this [GH repo](https://github.com/kjaymiller/Jays-PopClip-Snippets).
