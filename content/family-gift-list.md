title: Benefits of a Family Gift Site
---

I recently created [millerfamilygifts.netlify.app](https://millerfamilygifts.netlify.app).

Here's Why:

## Family asks me

My family is pretty extended between the 4 sets of parental units (including inlaws) and many of their grandparents still being around. Now when they ask me what I want. I can send them a list.

## It's pretty easy to maintain #

This list is built using [Render Engine][Render Engine], [GitHub][GitHub], and [Netlify][Netlify]. I plan to also update it via [Bunch](https://bunchapp.co) in the future.

It seems like a lot but really it's the same system this site runs on (but much simpler.)

## Small Projects are Fun

Recently, Merlin dropped some more wisdom on [DBF](https://dobyfriday.com/episodes/266) (Maybe it was the aftershow so sorry for stolen content).

> Don't make a database for something a spreadsheet will do...

While the site contains neither, it is just some markdown files that I update and then run the script to push live (for now) I don't need anything too fancy.

At some point things will get more complicated but doing complicated things on simple things is much better than complicated things on complicated things.
