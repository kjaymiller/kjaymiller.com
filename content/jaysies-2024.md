Wow 2024 was super busy. Whether it was my departure from Microsoft early in the year to join Aiven, or my exploration as an open source maintainer.

## What are the Jaysies?

In 2020, I made up an award that I give to folks. It is part of giving people their flowers, and a way to time-capsule the some of the highlights of the year (and those that made it great).

This year we have three categories returning from last year and 1 new one.

The returning categories are:

- Best Personal Moment
- Group Moment
- Best 1:1 Moment

## Best Personal Moment

This is an acknowledgment of some of the biggest personal moments of the year. This year there were a lot of amazing things that happened:

The honorable mentions are:

- Getting [PRs on ValkeyPy merged](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-py/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Akjaymiller)
- [Becoming a PSF Fellow](https://kjaymiller.com/blog/on-becoming-a-psf-fellow.html)
- [Speaking to students at Howard University](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kjaymiller_yall-i-had-an-amazing-experience-talking-activity-7257452634305892352-mHBd)
- [Black Python Devs (BPD) becomes a non-profit](https://blackpythondevs.com/2024-05-17-non-profit-announcement/)
- Becoming a Braves Season Ticket Holder

### Best Personal Moment Winner: PyCon US Keynote

[When I was asked to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYZBpoYjxLo) in December 2023 I was stunned. Having talked to many keynote speakers about making that step in my career, I've learned that much of it is _keep doing your thang_. I've done a lot of fun things in the Python community; I'm happy that this one, arguably the most important one, received very early recognition.

I didn't create BPD with the idea of it getting me an opportunity to keynote at events. In fact, many folks encouraged me to use the opportunity of keynoting to let people better understand the young org's needs. That being said, being asked to talk about it tells me that the Python Software Foundation understands there is a larger issue of the PSF's monocultural identity and that organizations outside its influence can work to help broaden the community through multi-cultural leadership.

I hoped that one day I would be asked to keynote and I'm happy the opportunity was well received.

## Best Group Moment

Group moments are really a highlight for me. Being relatively introverted I always enjoy when I can have a moment with a few folks that really stands out.

The honorable mentions:

- Relay's 10th Anniversary Event
- Canadian Thanksgiving
- Render ATL Lunch where we COMPLETELY BY Accident were a part of a themed lunch that looked like a murder mystery about to happen

### Best Group Moment Winner - Ibiza, No Pleasa

This one was hard because normally I try not to let work colleagues or events win. In a moment where I needed time away from a work event, some very amazing colleagues and I took in the amazing city of Tarragona, Spain.

A special thanks to Jenn and Celeste for saving me and creating the wonderful team that will be forever known as "Ibiza, No Pleasa". Thank you for giving me a memorable time of exploring monuments, trying amazing coffee, and some of the best fish I've ever had.

## Best 1:1 Moment

1:1 Moments are so great. I've learned that in those small moments you can make a friend for life. Or you can build those inside jokes or learn something new that will mean something for years to come.

The honorable mentions:

- The Manhattan Speakeasy Tour with Erin Mikail Staples
- The Late Night London Walk with my wife - Britnie Miller
- The Pain of Prometheus with Nick Rycar
- Giving a pie to Ashley Willis
- A developer chat with Chris May
- A lunch with Kelsey Hightower
- A happy hour conversation with Kelsey Hightower's kid
- Jay and Ponders dissect AI's ability to understand regional influence via Wu-Tang Clan and Migos-inspired raps on late stage capitalism.
- Streaming with Damien Hale

### Best 1:1 Moment Winner - The London Tower Convos with Cindy Greeley

This year's shout out is rigged because we have history. There has now been a Mother/[Daughter](https://kjaymiller.com/blog/jaysies-2021.html#kathy-campbellhttpstwittercommrssoup) combo of winners.

While waiting for our group to finish the Tower of London tour, I got to have a conversation with my cohost Kathy's mother about them, life, getting older and still being surprised. It's great because I talk to Kathy all the time and to be able to learn more about how her opinions were developed gives me so much respect for her. I also love conversations that feel so small in the moment but can really make someone's day.

Cindy, it was lovely meeting you! Thank you for the brief but delightful conversation and I'm so happy that you were able to join us in London.

Congratulations to all of the winners of this year's Jaysies!
