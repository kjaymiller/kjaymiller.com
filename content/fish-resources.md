<p>Due to a lack of support by some services that I use very regularly, I have stopped using fish and have gone back to zsh.</p>

I do a lot of work in the terminal. I understand that for many it's the lack of glitz and glamour that keeps people away from it, and while the majority of my computer usage is in some GUI, there are still many things that I can do much faster using a script that I can launch from my terminal.

Fish (Short for Friendly Interactive Shell) was a great attempt to add some modern-ness to the terminal environment. That said it has been around since the 90's as this boutique experience that some love, many ignore, and even more fear.

Well, fear not. Here are a few links that can help introduce you to fish and help you get out the gate quickly.
