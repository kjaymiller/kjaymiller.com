I'm always on the hunt for new cofee to sip on.

This will be a landing page for coffee's that I've tried and things. There may be a coffee exclusive blog eventually but this is what's there for now.

## My Current Setup

### Espresso

I have a [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://amzn.to/4aHYZ8l). It's been a great machine. I've only changed the spring to a 9-bar one but I'm looking to do more mods in the future.

I have the following Mods

### <span id="spring-mod">Spring Mod</span>

The Gaggia is a great machine but it's set to 15 bars of pressure. This means you have to use pressurized baskets. I've changed the spring to a 9 bar spring. This allows me to use unpressurized baskets.

### Pour Over

I use a [Chemex](https://amzn.to/47r7TEp). This is what I use to make coffee for myself and guests when I'm not making espresso.

## Grinders

I have two grinders that I use, one for espresso and one for pour over. This is mostly to prevent having to change grind settings and re-dialing in my espresso.

- [MiiCoffee DF64 II Single Dosing Coffee Grinder (Black)](https://amzn.to/41Uqo2T) (I actually have the older model that is no longer available) - This is my espresso grinder.

- [Baratza Encore Conical Burr Coffee Grinder White](https://amzn.to/3vlwb5n) - This is my pour over grinder. I've had it for years and it's been great. That said trying to dial it in for espresso is a pain because it's not stepless and it clogs easily.
