title: My Content Creation Standards for this Site and my Personal Brand
slug: content-standards
---

This is my personal blog that I have been running since before I was in the tech industry. That doesn't mean that I don't occasionally write or share about things that I'm doing at work.

Throughout my career I've been in different industries and have learned about several tools and platforms. Often me sharing things of my blog is to:

1. inform you about the things I've learned so that you may learn about them as well
2. give myself some future searchable tips in a style that my brain will pick up on quickly

## Anything I talk about on my personal channels is based on my opinion and experience at the time it's published. 

Thoughts can change and if they do I'm more than happy to provide updates to those thoughts.

## My has no say what I publish on my personal channels with the explicit exception to aggregation channels

Occasionally I will publish things on an account that is meant to be an aggregation channel. These are platforms like dev.to, micro.blog, ALL SOCIAL MEDIA.

If our company is doing a blog series on YouTube, Social Media, or a Blog channel or network, I may publish from a personal account and have it linked to that aggregation.

## Disclosures establish trust and I am happy to provide them

At the time of writing this, I'm working to implement a way to clearly disclose when I'm writing about things that I'm doing for work. I still will support them but the reality is if I wasn't working around the tech I would likely not be using it.
