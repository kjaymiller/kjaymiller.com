Because I looked online for a list of project ideas and couldn't find one. I made one myself.

While I don't have examples for all of these. I'm sure that people that find this post can submit a PR with theirs if one doesn't exist. Perhaps instead of that, an awesome list can be started (Just not by me).


- Asset Inventory (CCG Enthusiasts)
- [Plant Monitoring](https://github.com/kjaymiller/plant-tracker) (Plant Heads)
- Maintenance Tracker
- Personal AI bot, Journal, Something Content Based
- Spending Tracker
- Milestone Tracker
- Blood Sugar Tracker T1D/T2D
- Something with Location
- Build something that shouldn’t use PostgreSQL with it and learn why you shouldn’t

The trick will be to do as much as possible only from the PostgreSQL side. So before you can build your fancy vibe-coded app, first create the view, find out if it should be materialized or not.


Now go build ALL THE THINGS
