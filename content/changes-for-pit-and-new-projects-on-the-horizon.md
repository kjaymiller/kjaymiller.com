Now here's the scoop.

**The PIT Podcast will be winding down.** I will be releasing the remaining interviews in their raw format with the aftershow's included.

**I will be starting an audio newsletter that will be premium only, meaning you will need to pay for the audio version which will include interviews**. More on that in the future as I'm trying to get the logistics of that ironed out.

**I'm working on a potential book** or a really long blog post.

**My blog will get a little more buckshot**. This means that I will be talking about a bunch of things.

**The newsletter will be more valuable as it will have a recap of all the things I'm working on**. Please subscribe.

**My future in podcasting will be limited run shows...And maybe a show with a friend** Still working on things there but safe to say new projects will be limited run seasons with other things around them.

**Taking a break with new clients for PIT**. I need time to focus on my health and happiness and some of the projects that I'm working on. I will continue to make things that I want to make, but I won't be taking new clients at the moment.
