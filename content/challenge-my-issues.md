title: I wish more folks new to OSS would question my issues

Working with beginning contributors (and their AI tools), I notice they are eager to do the task and not eager to question should the task even be done.

I have [this issue that I'm considering](https://github.com/render-engine/render-engine/issues/950) that brings up the question of should we move some tests into their own file.

I don't know if this is the right move or not. Someone may have a valid reason why we shouldn't do it.

I'm sure more folks would just do it and not question it. Also since AI is eager to please, I don't trust it to give me the best judgment either.

Issues should be a discussion first and foremost. Using tools like [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) gives people the ability to get credit for contributing, even when they don't write a line of code. I would rather have lines of code prevented that committed (especially if I'll have to go back and delete them in the future).
