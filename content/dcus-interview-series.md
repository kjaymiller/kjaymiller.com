[All the videos for _DjangoCon US 2024 Perspectives_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NFhrDSOxgVFmeAjIMjIyNesLJbwj_-K) are now live.

This year, we had a dedicated space and a small team to help with the interviews. I even had [Kudzayi Bamhare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayi-bamhare-3b6991b7) help out and do one of the interviews.

Thank you for the DCUS team to ask me to get involved with this and I'm excited that we have a process that will to make things better in 2025 at the next DCUS.
