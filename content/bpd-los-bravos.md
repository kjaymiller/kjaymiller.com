I do my best to go watch the Atlanta Braves on every #LosBravosNight and have done so three out of the last four years.

In today's divided world we MUST remember America's beauty comes from a multitude of cultures bringing the best of that culture and sharing it with us. These players bring their own style, and heritage and are proud of represent their countries while playing at the highest level.

Last year I had the privilege of taking my good friend [Andres Pineda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinedax/) to his first Braves game when we got to root for his new favorite Brave and fellow Dominican Marcel Ozuna. It wasn't Los Bravos Night but was a great game in which came down to the very end.

During that night we started talking about how Black Python Devs could support Python communities in Latin America.

We understand that blackness doesn't mean the same everywhere we go, but our support has been welcomed in parts of Colombia, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic.

The Python culture in LATAM gives me the same feeling that I see on Los Bravos Night. It is a group of Pythonistas who love their culture, their country and want to see the same opportunities for community in their hometowns that feel only available in the US and Europe.

That's a mission that Black Python Devs is proud to support. This year, we sponsored three events in Latin America and we have a lofty goal to triple that number by 2027.

You can help us by:

1. making introductions to Python community leaders across Latin America.
2. spread the word about Black Python Devs mission to support the establishment and sustainability of Python events and communities of Black, Coloured, and other historically excluded communities around the world
3. support that mission financially with a one-time or recurring donation.
