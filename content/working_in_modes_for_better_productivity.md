title: Presenting Working in Modes for Better Productivity
---

I had the privilege of presenting to the [Suburban Chicago Apple Users](https://myscau.org) meetup. This was a great opportunity to to chat with many Apple enthusiasts and share two of my favorite apps ([Hook](https://hookproductivity.com) and [Bunch](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/)).

A big shoutout to [Brett Terpstra](https://twitter.com/ttscoff) and [Luc P. Beaudoin](https://twitter.com/LucCogZest) for hanging out in the chat and the excellent feedback!

You can view my slides [here](https://kjaymiller.azureedge.net/media/Working%20in%20Modes%20for%20Better%20Productivity.pdf) and a video will be made available in the near future.
