Since the Quarantine, I've been goign on two weekly walks with a couple of PIT
Premium Members.

This allows me to do a few things.

- Catch up/Learn more with members of my community
- Get some exercise
- Vent about whatever it is I need to vent about.

I've been struggling to keep weight off as my asthma has been worsening with
the weight gain. If my friends are not available, I tend to take this route
with my headphones in and use the time to decompress or just think about
things. Also the time away from my computer really helps.
