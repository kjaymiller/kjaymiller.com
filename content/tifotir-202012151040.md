Here are some things that I found around the web lately that I think folks will enjoy. No Affiliate links so if you are happy about these and want to support, then share the post with your friends or consider [sponsoring all my projects][GitHub Sponsors]! 


## [GoodLinks][GoodLinks]
[GoodLinks][Goodlinks] was one of the first apps that I saw that was taking advantage of iCloud sync. There are many apps like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com), [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io). There is also the darling [pinboard](https://pinboard.in). 

I noticed these subscription services were paying mostly for plain-text storage. I could get the URL, the title, and tags, but if I wanted access to the content, good luck. Even when I could store offline versions of pages, I couldn't access them via an API. I wanted to be able to integrate my bookmarking service and make it searchable with other tools. 

Goodlinks is a bookmarking service with great simplicity, which is what I was looking for. Everything is available and stored locally via iCloud with. I recently figured out how to [get access to Safari history](http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-your-browser-history/).  I think I can do something similar with GoodLinks.

Right now, I'm bookmarking web things in GoodLinks. When I feel I have enough content to release another TIFOTIR, I pull from there (instead of my head).


## [Dracula Theme][Dracula]
I spend much of my time in [iTerm2]. Just because the terminal may be an _old- school_ way of doing things doesn't mean I should keep my screen in the old school. [Oh-my-zsh] gives me plenty of great plugin access and themes out of the box, but I wanted a theme that was somewhat subtle that would just pop out some of the information that I should be looking for.

[Dracula] does a wonderful job not adding a lot of complexity to my terminal but emphasizes bits of data. Also they have many themes for other applications. I am also using their [Alfred Theme](https://draculatheme.com/alfred)

## [What I learned from Close Call Interviews](https://catvscode.hashnode.dev/what-i-learned-from-close-call-interviews) (via [@catvscodes](https://twitter.com/@catvscode))

I met to Cat via Twitter. She's a wonderful UI Engineer with a ton of experience. That said, HIRE HER if you're hiring!

I spent a lot of time not getting interviews (straight ghosted üëª). Cat's been getting so close in interviews. It hurts a lot when the you invest a lot of time into landing that job and you don't get it.

This was a good reminder of a few things.

> Never, ever believe anything anyone says until the offer is in front of your face with your name on it...

> And if they didn't pick you, it's their loss. Don't waste time fretting about why it wasn't you or singing the hymn of the impostor on repeat.

It's a little bit of a bummer but it's a reality that we often don't think about. Thank you Cat for the perspective and I'm seriously rooting for you!

## [On Collecting No's](https://glasnt.com/blog/on-collecting-nos) (via [@glasnt](https://twitter.com/glasnt))

Funny thing happened the other day, I got a rejection email from a conference saying that my talk. This was a conference that I REALLY wanted to speak at. I had also recieved rejections to a few other conferences a couple weeks before. On top of that, I am an advocate so speaking at conferences is a bit of an expectation. 

Recently, I met [Katie](https://twitter.com/glasnt) at a conference organizers meeting. She's absolutely wonderful and a fellow advocate. She wrote a post a while back about putting conference talk rejections into perspective.

My personal Favorite note:

> Your submission was a sales pitch. Okay, look. I know. Sales people gotta sales. But, when a conferences asks ‚ÄúNo pitches‚Äù and you throw a dozen ‚ÄúBUY ME NOW‚Äù submissions, yeah, you‚Äôre going to get rejected.

Oh yeah the funny part... Apparently, I submitted two talks to the conference and the other one was with a different account. They accepted that talk but message went to spam. Luckily I was looking for another email and found it... üòÖ

## [10 Fun Gift Subscription Boxes for Kids](https://www.wired.com/gallery/gift-subscriptions-for-kids/)

I normally don't promote these big editorial teams, but as a dev-dad, I am always trying to get fun projects for me and the little one to play around with. We use KiwiCo and she get the 2-5 year old's box. I do plan on looking into some of the other boxes in the new year.
