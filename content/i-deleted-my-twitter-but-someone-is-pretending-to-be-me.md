title: I Deleted My Twitter Account bug someone is pretending to be me.
description: A warning about someone impersonating my identity on X.com. Twitter offers no recourse without rejoining the platform.
---

I didn't want to write a break up letter with X.com (formerly Twitter). I hate these kinds of posts...

But I was made aware that someone has created an account at @kjaymiller which was my old profile. They are also using my old profile photo.

I don't promote crypto. It's not my thing. It also says in the profile that I'm affiliated with "VenomGuard" which is affiliated with Solana... Ain't Me. Don't know them. Lastly it has a blue check... I ain't ever had a blue check and have no intention on buying one.

If I had to guess they are looking at my old tweets or other social media accounts and using that to tweet things that seem plausible (Weather getting better in Atlanta, Me speaking at PyTexas... This is all public info that easy to find on other social media as well as my blog.) My guess is AI.

## Twitter isn't Helping

X.com (Twitter) isn't helping with this because in order to report someone for impersonation, the person they are impersonating HAS to have an account on the platform. I will not create another account and give X.com any inflated numbers on users on the platform.

Twitter, you're a joke. You can delete all the bots on my account when I refuse to give you money to lower my followers (which I don't care), but when someone pretends to be someone you the situation up for ransom to force people to sign up for your platform. I hear of people not deleting their account because they are worried about this and you provide no recourse.

Apparently I can give them my ID and they will hold it for processing for 30 days. I also need to log into my X.com account (THAT I DELETED AND SOMEONE IS NOW USING).

## This is a point of record in the event someone is pretending to use my account for nefarious reasons

I'm writing this purely in the event that some future employer looks at something from an account on Twitter that is not me. I deleted my account back in January 2025 and have email proof of deactivating 2FA (which you have to do to delete your account) and others verifying that my account was deleted.

## What can you don

If you see content from a twitter account using @kjaymiller as a username and my face is on it, report it for spam because you can't report it for impersonation.

Also if someone does want to get in touch with me, email me using one of the methods on my [about page](/about).
