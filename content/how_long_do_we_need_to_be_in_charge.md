title: How Long Should We Be in Charge
description: When you've been involved for a long time, it's hard to let go of it. This piece helps me inspect my feelings of long-term governance.

## How long do you need to be

A conversation with a DSF member led up to the question:

"How long do you need to be in the community to benefit from it" and the more relevant question

> "How long do leaders need to stick around before you're actively preventing progress" - Me (Yeah I said it!)

## This isn't an attack on the _old guard_

I love my friends that were sitting in the Kansas Newspaper building what would become Django core, Django-admin and many other magic components that make Django the technical wonder used by trillion dollar companies around the world (seriously they should [give them more money](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/)) . I somehow find myself having dinner with many of these folks every year at DjangoCon US. These conversations (like at a Thanksgiving dinner) devolve into how the community and language (Python) is governed and what _could/should be_ done better if our person was (or wasn't in charge).

I'm guilty as in my time I've mentioned that I would like to see both the DSF and PSF adopt:

- regional leadership more akin to the United Nation's model
- more apprenticeship opportunities for folks that would like to become contributors long term
- contributions counting up to the issue reporting level

I was told that my ideas weren't necessarily bad and I should consider running for the board if I were serious about bring some changes. Three failed elections later I find myself implementing these and other ideas in [Black Python Devs](https://blackpythondevs.com).

But I look at another DSF election and I'm happy to see some new faces (and some old ones).

## I'm and insider looking in

Don't get me wrong. I talk about my friends as if I'm on the same level with them... I'm absolutely NOT. I've deployed perhaps no more than 4 Django apps to a public URL in my lifetime which likely saw a combined 1000 unique visitors and racked up an over $10k AWS bill. Every year (for the last 3) I go to DjangoCon US and spend more time at the sponsor's booths and in the beginner-friendly talks than anywhere else. But lately I've seen something happen.

Many recent conversations (some over pedicures) with some of Django's first _governors_ talk about exhaustion and desire for change but a sense of need for sticking around. Those that have stepped away still think and speak about governance but do it more as an advisor. Those that are still around feel as If they long to fill that role themselves, if only they could step away. My thought is that I think they can today _if they chose to_.

## Newcomers are hungry

Newcomers are doing things and making a huge impact. I don't mean Python Newbies (I mean some would call themselves that), but new names that aren't synonymous with Django. People like **Mario Munoz** who made his name in the Django community with the amazing opening salvo _[Why I didn't start with Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2CsQXONTxw)_. Mario would go on to Keynote DjangoCon US 2024. Folks like **Kudzayi Bamhare** who, went from deploying his first Django app to the web at DCUS 2024 to Helping at a DjangoGirls Event at PyCon Zim in about two weeks. I also see many faces that came from the 2 year-ish old [Djangonaut.space](https://djangonaut.space) program that serves as a mentorship program to continue development in the Django community. I saw recent Djangonaut.space grad **Afi Gbadago** get announced to the DSF Board.

## We see the need for change over time

I'm not saying we immediately drop all the board members that came from its first days. I'm saying I keep hearing the same people say "I want new faces" and they continue to run for positions. Much of the things I see happening in governance is the rooting out of _apples_. Many policies have been made to make the community space more inclusive and some folks don't like those changes so they _bounce or get bounced_.

These changes are coming because many at the top see the need for change. My fear is that they want to see the change happen their way and they'll stick around until it happens or they find themselves not belonging (which I don't think would happen).

## It's okay if we don't implement it your way

Python has changed how it has been managed and governed a few times now. Paul Everett mentioned in a [recent podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQylj1i3Rog):

> Python went into the commons, and the commons was able to administer it.

Guido's _permanent vacation from being BDFL_ gave me (about 4 years into Python) some trepidation about the languages future. Too bad I didn't know Guido at the time. I also didn't read [his words](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html).

> I'm not worried about the day to day decisions in the issue tracker or on GitHub. Very rarely I get asked for an opinion, and usually it's not actually important...
>
> The decisions that most matter are probably
>
> How are PEPs decided
> How are new core devs inducted

In the moment of stepping away Guido was mostly concerned with how to continue bringing in new people to the community.

In 2023 [I interviewed Brett Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jlaS8j5zqI) who had decided to step away from his steering council role. He mentioned stepping down after 5 years of serving on the steering council to match his initial consideration of a 5 year term limit to match the support cycle of a single version.

> I'm going to step down and I'm going to guarantee there is an open seat...I want to make sure there is an opportunity to have some change.

He also mentioned that somehow Python's steering council had someone that was in their 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year, and he being the 5th year was stepping down. This is an amazing coincidence and gives me confidence that some of our most seasoned folks can look to those that have been around for a couple years to help grow the next batch of leaders.

## How do we fix this

Ultimately, I believe we continue to have more conversation around governance and leadership in public and loudly. It seems to be the only thing that my friends talk about but the conversations are always over dinner or in a 1:1 discord call. In Black Python Devs Leadership Summit we were lucky to have the presence of two long-term DSF members, the founders of about 3 different organizations, one of original creators of the PSF, and current PSF employee. As many of Black Python Devs young leadership corps was beginning to talk about burnout, they all suggested contingency plans. In fact, much of the advice given has been discuss and some major changes to governance will be seen in early 2025.

## I mean this for me as well

I'm bringing this up around the DSF election and I've been referencing it mostly because I do think there is a problem with many of the Django community leaders being some of it's founding fathers (that word specifically because they are almost all male or male-identifying). I write this looking at my own decisions as well. BPD has no term limits (again stay tune for announcements at the end of the year). The executor role is a BDFL role. That said my goal is to find my successor as soon as possible. Not so that hopefully in the next 5 years I can find myself in a similar situation as to Guido. _Very rarely I get asked for an opinion, and usually it's not actually important_.

I don't think Python or Django is going away any time soon. But the landscape is varying and we're seeing many of the new leaders coming from different locations speaking different languages. I have no fear that we'll get to a position where Python will continue to set the example for every other language in its welcoming and enchanting community. My only fear is that it will take longer than it needed to because no one stepped down to _make sure there is an opportunity to have some change_.
