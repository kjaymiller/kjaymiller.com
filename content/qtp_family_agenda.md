title: Quick Productivity Tip - The Upcoming Family Agenda
---

I've recently been doing weekly reviews with my wife (GTD addicts calm down, not that kind of review). Mostly we just cover my schedule and plan our meals for the week. This has been amazing for us as it gets us on the same page and eliminates any last minute decisions. 

Also, I'm not always thinking about what my wife has on her schedule. So this allows me to check the _Family Calendar_ and make sure that anything that will impact the family or our routine is on there. I also put our weekly meal plan in OmniFocus with the tag: _Dinner_.
