Happy to share that I got to speak at Juneteenth conf this year!
It's one of the events that I hope will continue to grow as the years go on!

### NOTE: When the videos go live I will update this post... But you can watch the VOD of the livestream

My talk starts around 1:43:00

If you want to checkout the datasets that I worked with and how I got them into elasticsearch, checkout the repos on Github.
