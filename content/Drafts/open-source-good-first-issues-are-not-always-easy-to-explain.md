title: "Good First Issues Aren't Always Good (But can be issues)"

I'm a big fan of giving people easy tasks to entice them into contributing. In fact, many of my most regular contributors to projects that I work on have been from issues labeled `good first issue`.

Most of these issues are ones that I bump into while working on another issue and thing "I could fix this really quick...". That said, sometimes I think the problem is quick but turns out it's more complicated than it seems.

Take, for instance [issue 391 on the Black Python Devs Website](https://github.com/blackpythondevs/blackpythondevs.github.io/issues/391). This issue was to mark our Open Source Program as closed. Simple task right. Currently says open, should say closed. Why then did I reject the issue that did exactly that.

> NOTE:
> I was the one that created this issue so in many ways I have only myself to blame.

## Bad title and body will lead to bad PRs

My first problem was that my title and description was incredibly weak.

> Mark the open-source-program-page as closed
> Currently the open source page says that applications are still open. This was closed.
