title: "Good First Issues Aren't Always Good (But can be issues)"

I'm a big fan of giving people easy tasks to entice them into contributing. In fact, many of my most regular contributors to projects that I work on have been from issues labeled `good first issue`.

Most of these issues are ones that I bump into while working on another issue and thing "I could fix this really quick...". That said, sometimes I think the problem is quick but turns out it's more complicated than it seems.

Take, for instance [issue 391 on the Black Python Devs Website][gh issue]. This issue was to mark our Open Source Program as closed. Simple task right. Currently says open, should say closed. Why then did I reject the issue that did exactly that.

> NOTE:
> I was the one that created this issue so in many ways I have only myself to blame.

## Bad title and body will lead to bad PRs

My first problem was that my title and description was incredibly weak.

> **Title**: Mark the open-source-program-page as closed
> **Body**: Currently the open source page says that applications are still open. This was closed.

If I'm being honest this was a description for me.

After rejecting a pr changed the word `open` to `closed` in the header I decided if someone else was going to work on it, then I should give them more guidance.

[Here is what I suggested][gh issue], after thinking about it for more that 5 seconds suggested.

> Just changing the header will not suffice on this.
> The program will open and close throughout the year. I would definitely consider making things a little more dynamic.
>
> Example:
> We can set projects in `_data/data.yml` that can be updated.
>
> Some values can be:
>
> - list of projects being worked on
> - status if program is open or closed
>   I would then create three templates.
>   A base template that will check it the program in `site.data.open_source_program.open == true/false
>
> if true (open):
> include open_source_program_open.html
> else:
> include open_source_program_closed.html

## That doesn't look like a good first issue

I mean if you're familiar with [Jekyll](ruby jekyll) or [Jinja](jinja2)
