   I am writing this based on a message that I posted in a work slack. The opinion is mine and mine alone.

There have been a lot of large companies that are promising the future of X.

TigerData - "Building the Modern PostgreSQL for the Analytical and Agentic Era"


I can appreciate the work that TigerData has been putting in as I think the plugins they have published

As a Python developer this gives me the same vibe as all the development in Rust because we have to make things faster.
I think it's perfectly fine to want to improve the performance of Postgres and say "that is how we win"... but the way that we build the BEST version of Postgres is not with a proprietary fork. It's by working closely with those that are building Postgres and saying "what can we do to make it faster?"
I think the best example of this is what we're doing with Inkless. Diskless Kafka got the reception we wanted because we announced it after all the Kafka organizers got on board and said "We do need a better way of doing this". And when we announced our intention to make it open source and just make it how Kafka works made all the folks doing similar things come out and share their opinions... all of this makes for better Kafka for everyone.. It's how Kafka wins.
(where my technical knowledge is at it's limit) Right now there are so many folks doing similar things in a proprietary manner and talking about it as "modern postgres". Until I can run it on my local machines as easy as brew install postgres , I don't think any proprietary solution will be MODERN POSTGRES.
I also want to acknowledge the work that many contributors to postgres are doing to make the MODERN POSTGRES - including our own
@Patrick St√§hlin
 who got his first contribution merged earlier this week (or last week). PG is getting faster and more efficient with every release. I wish these companies (including us) dedicated more time to contributing to those efforts
Aiven wins when our developer experience shines. We can build a good experience of working with PG and all our services when we know that we're choosing the best in class open source database services
