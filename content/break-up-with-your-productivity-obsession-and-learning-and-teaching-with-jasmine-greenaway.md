title: Break up with your Productivity Obsession and Learning and Teaching with Jasmine
  Greenaway
---

Jay seems to have broken up with productivity as an obsession and now he's missing the thrill of the hunt.

My guest this week is a Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, Brooklyn.js organizer, and lecturer, Jasmine Greenaway.

We talk about the benefits of coming into a role where you can learn and teach.
