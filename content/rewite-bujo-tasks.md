title: The "Problem" with rewriting tasks in your Bullet Journal
---

I was recently asked about the headache of re-writing things in my Bullet Journal. I have an interesting trick in fixing that. 

## I do the task so I don't have to write it down more than once or twice. 

If I have to write it down more than twice, I must convince myself that is a task worth keeping. I do this by looking at how long a task will take. If less than 30 minutes, I do it on the spot.

This idea is like that of a Mitch Hedberg joke.

> I sit in a hotel and think of something funny. When I think of something,  I get a pen and pad and write it down. If I can't find a pen or pad, I convince myself that what I just thought of was not that funny[^1]. 

I often convince myself to do the thing instead of writing it down for the umpteenth-time. Alternatively, I strike it and say, "This isn't important".
