title: Talk Ideas for 2025
---

I have a feeling that I won't be able to attend as many Python events on behalf of my employer next year so I am throwing out there a list of talks that I'm planning on submitting.

I'm going to break them down into 3 categories: Keynote Level and Standard Talk. I'm happy to talk more about each of these on in detail on social media perhaps.

## Keynote

### No role modelz

The full title is No Role Modelz: How to grow in your development career when you're the only one in the room. This talk is meant to be given with homage paid to the iconic song of the same name by J.Cole.

### What package management taught me about building communities (and vice-versa)

Self explanatory. I have a bunch of packages on PyPI and elsewhere and I have used much of that knowledge to influence how we operate at Black Python Devs.

### A dropout's guide to a DevRel career

Many have heard me tell folks that I dropped out of college, joined the military and then automated myself out of one job and into a career as a Developer Advocate.

### How to get over fear and contribute to open source

I have heard a few folks tell me that they want to be an open source contributor but think that it's too hard. This talk would work to dispell some myths about contributing to open source.

## Standard Talks

### Building replicate-able TUIs with Textual and DuckDB

I am constantly learning things and needing to remember them. That's why I started making digital cookbooks, or quick references that I can use to give myself a quick reference. I'll walk through the decisions made and why using DuckDB along with JSON allows for amazing flexibility, while Textual enables an interactive way to discover, retain, and recall information.

### Playwright testing tips for small teams

Every year I do a little more with Playwright and use it to ensure that my site doesn't get worse from an accessibility standpoint.

Testing with Playwright can feel a little stressful when you are a single developer.

I'm here as a Playwright enthusiast to share some tips I've learned by using playwright to manage many small sites on projects where I'm the primary (and sometimes only) maintainer.

### Search Types in Postgres, OpenSearch®️ do you still need dedicated search in 2025

I've talked to folks, especially in the django space and I've been asked a few times "With Django Full Text Search and PG Vector do I need a dedicated search solution like OpenSearch®️." I aim to perform some side by side tests that compare things like price, implementation, and performance to see if there indeed is a reason to have a dedicated search solution.
