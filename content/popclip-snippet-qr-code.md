title: Generate QR Codes Using PopClip and Shortcuts
---

While checking email I saw there was a new popclip forum post[^1] where OP was asking for a snippet that generated a qr code...

I did that thing where I started typing before my brain could stop me.

"If you're using Montery you can run a shortcut to do this." I know that because [I have a shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dcbf15666e0e4412b35350dcb70559b7) that does it.

Also, popclip extension snippets support shortcuts.

```
# popclip Generate QR Code
name:  QR
requirements: [url]
icon: square q
shortcut name: QR Code
```

Here is a quick demo of it working...

Also I talk about a bunch of different things you can do with Popclip extension snippets in this video.
