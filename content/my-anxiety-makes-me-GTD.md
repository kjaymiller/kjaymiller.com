title: My Anxiety Makes Me Get Things Done
---

Recently I've been on a tear with new podcasts, live streams, and communities.

My secret is these are all _cries for help_.

Not in a life threatening way, but in the stuck in an axiety induced feedback loop.

I've learned over time that my compulsion tick when going through a period of high anxiety is to do more. There is also a level of tension that is created in the process. I tend to buck against authority. Forget about things that are of some importance. And be more _fatalistic_ and irrational towards things not going according to plan.

### Does this invalidate all of the things that I'm Making?
*HELL TO THE NAW NAW NAW*

It just puts things into perspective. When I get anxious I build more things to distract me from the things that are causing the anxiety. These are usually things on my list of things I would like to do and I'm more passionate about them in that time than I will ever be.

I will devote hours and hours to those things to avoid the things causing anxiety.

### Why are you telling us this?
I'm telling you this to remind you that it is something that people deal with and often those people that are creative are using their creativity and entreprenuerial spirit as a way to mask a pain that is deep and often not fully understood.

It took me seeing a mental health professional and a level of medication before I became aware of this. I hope you will read this and think about that ambitious person in your life (other than me) and just check up on them. They may look like they are doing great on the inside, but they may also be asking for help.

**NOTE**:

I understand that this seems super dark. Me writing about it helps tto analyze my thoughts and make sense of things.

I can't say that I'm 100% okay, but getting this out does help and helping more people to understand helps even more.
