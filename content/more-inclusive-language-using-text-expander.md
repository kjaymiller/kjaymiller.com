title: More Inclusive Language Using TextExpander
---

It's such a simple productivity hack, but for the last few years, I've been trying to stop saying _just do X_.

Plenty of articles discuss how the word _just_ minimizes the effort you're putting in ([here's one](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-i-quit-using-the-word-just-in-my-emails)).

## It's not About Me

The bigger reason to drop this word is that I also work with folks trying to make some of their first contributions to open-source.

I don't have many open-source contributions outside of projects I'm responsible for. My first few attempts at submitting a PR didn't go too well (and I've developed a lasting disdain for RST because of it).

There is a significant amount of effort put in by folks who have looked for good first issues, volunteered to tackle a problem, and then submitted the PR. Saying "Just add _X_" or "Just follow the steps in _Y_" magnifies any potential issue that arises.

Me: This was supposed to be easy. I'm not good at this.

Reality: The instructions may not have been clear to me, or I'm facing a language barrier, or some other unforeseen issue made this task harder than expected (I'm definitely guilty of that last one and apologize for the false hope I've given to folks).

### On to the solution

I've used [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) for years. This snippet works by removing the word just (the word _just_ followed by a space).

Now, I have to make a dedicated decision to use the word.

An interesting tidbit is that TextExpander will give analytics so over time (if I really wanted to), I could see how my usage of the word changed.

### Future ideas

I want to try this for a few days before doing the same with other phrases such as "easy" and "simply".
