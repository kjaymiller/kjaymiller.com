So happy to see [Akamai](https://akamai.com) posting roles on Black Tech Pipeline.

Never heard of Black Tech Pipeline... from their about page:

> We partner with different companies, programs and initiatives to provide opportunities to the Black tech community and our allies.

Some information - [Black Americans make up an unproportionally small percentage by population of tech workers](https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/KC22001_black-tech-report.final_.pdf) in the United States. [Black Women are incredibly underpaid talent in the market](https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BWEPD-2024.6.28v4.pdf).

Right now companies are being [threatened with loss of federal grants and opportunities if they participate if programs labelled as "DEI"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/).

I applaud the bravery of Akamai to do a thing that so many companies right now are **AFRAID**[^1] to do.

This made me so happy I cried. I'm proud that I know of some ways that I'm directly supporting the company through my work.

I'm considering using their products now to build some small projects I've been wanting to build.

[^1]: Yeah I said it... they are afraid.
