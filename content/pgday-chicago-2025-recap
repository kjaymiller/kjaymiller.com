I spent the last week in Chicago ~watching the Cubs play~ participating in a week of PostgreSQL. I didn't have any expectations going in but I think the results were beyond any expectation that I would have expected.

## Data Day helped leveled the playing field

Before the big conference, there was a PGDataDay presented by [Prairie Postgres](https://prairiepostgres.org/). The talks were amazing and especially helpful for me. I learned from [Lætitia Avrot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/l%C3%A6titia-avrot/) how to conceptualize my data structure using the [Meris Design System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merise). I learn about Database design being an art form and not a strict science. But with all art, you have tools to your art and that's where [Shaun Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonesmoses/) gave us everything we would need with his _DBA in a Box_ presentation.

It was great because I would be thinking about both workshops throughout the following day. I honestly thing that more conferences should make sure they have some beginner/early intermediate level content as a workshop for those who may be joining for the first time.

## Presenters have style (for the most part)

I was here working so that meant that I spent more time in the talks and less time in the hallway (I know the rules Hettie!).

Something that I like is that presenters all had their style and it was great! From the slides to the tools they used. I remember [Ryan Booz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanbooz/) in particular having a wonderful setup that not only showed his system running but we could see the number of cores being engaged (Ryan what was that!?)

Another amazing talk style was that of [Chelsea Dole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelsea-dole/) who admitted that her talk had been given so many times that she was extremely comfortable presenting it.

Throughout the talks it felt like people were extremely confident, even when giving your first presentation like [Doğaç Eldenk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dogacel/), the level of confidence that came from the presenters intimidated me a little which I felt in my talk.

## I only had to say it once

Something I can't say enough about the event is that I love is how people were so open to being friendly.

The security at the gate supported by my name tag both showed my legal name and not my preferred name. This is usually not a big deal except this was the first time I was being introduced to people. I tend to not be super vocal about my name or pronouns but when people care enough to ask and show compassion in not only remembering, but also saying helping others know was great. I had folks that I hadn't met that immediately called me _Jay_ and mentioned they had been told to come talk to me from others.

This was amazing, thank you.

## Understanding the need to get better but also respecting the wishes

I was uneasy giving my talk, which meant I probably went a little over the top. I did my very aggressive "I will have time for questions but not comments" which I saw some faces go from a smile to a slight frown.

While presenting I felt like I was able to keep people engaged. My presentation style was definitely not like the other talks but that wasn't a bad thing. I think the thing that made me feel uncomfortable was that I was defensive. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IN THE LAST WEEK.

After my talk was done I mentioned that I would definitely take comments and there were a few. But they are all friendly and AMAZING advice. In those comments, I learned about [pg-strom](https://github.com/heterodb/pg-strom), and how you could [implement RAG directly in your postgresDB](https://bonesmoses.org/2024/pg-phriday-brand-new-rag/). I also got more insight on the community's opinion on ORMs. I not only learned that it wasn't as hostile as people made it seem, but also there was a lot of context as to the [historical opinions](https://www.odbms.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/031.01-Neward-The-Vietnam-of-Computer-Science-June-2006.pdf) and how much much of those concerns still feel valid.

In the end, I was still trying to push [my project](https://github.com/kjaymiller/multi_service_ai_request) further and further and I had a few folks also invested in this to the point where I was inspired to submit a talk about my experience with JSON_TABLES (Thanks Dian).

## Am I slowly becoming a member of two communities

It feels weird to say but I'm definitely feeling more and more like a member of the PG community, if only at the beginning of my journey. I didn't want to compare the Python community and the PG community but the PG community feels like it embraces its smaller environment where Python seems to constantly want it to grow.  At a couple times, I felt at home welcome with the cadre of speakers I had met from the dinner the night before who worked hard to make me feel at home. Up to the afternoon after the event where the philosophical discussion started the night before with a cheers of Malört eased into the buffet at that Chicago Curryhouse where folks wanted to learn more and more about me, devrel, my career, passions and more. I look forward to the next time I'll get to hang with friends and hope they see me as the same.
