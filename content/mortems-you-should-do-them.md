title: 'Mortems: You Should Do Those'
---

Inspired by an app idea I had a couple years ago.

Here is some advice you can use for a Pre/Post Mortems.

## Defined Terms:

- [Pre-Mortem](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/seeing-what-others-dont/202101/the-pre-mortem-method): A meeting prior to the start of the project to gather ideas around a project that can identify key goals and potential pitfalls.
- Post-Mortem: Feedback once the project has been completed from those involved that identify the rights and wrongs of the project to help make better decisions in the future.

## Problems:

### Mortems are hard to template

Every project is different and will require some thought. That said you can start with the basics:

**Pre-Mortem**

- What OKRs will define the success of this project?
- What barriers will prevent us from reaching success in this project?
  - Is there anything we can do to reduce the potential of these barriers?
- Who are the stakeholders and what defines success to them?
- Will this project impact folks outside of our team? How involved should they be in this process?

**Post-Mortem**

- Based on the OKRs that we set, was the project successful? Did stakeholders find it successful as well?
- Did we prevent the expected barriers from arising?
- What unexpected barriers came up?

## It's good to remember:

- There should be no judgement and all voices should be heard. If you feel this would be challenging then work to anonymize the input.

- Invite Hard/Soft connections to project to participate in the conversation

  - Hard Connect - someone that will/has worked on the project
  - Soft Connect - someone impacted by the project (stakeholders, etc.)

- Make sure to keep a record of the Pre/Post Mortems as they can be helpful in the future.
