title: I Was Selected as a Mentee for the First Podcast Mentorship Cohort
---

I'm a firm believer that it is incredibly hard to be a _self taught_ anything.

In fact one of the **easiest** ways to learn is sharing and learning from others.

That's why I'm happy to announce I'll be doing just that as a member of the
first cohort of the [Podcast Mentorship Program](https://www.podcastmentorship.net)), imagined by the legendary [Myke
Hurley](https://twitter.com/imyke).

In a conversation on [Analog(ue)](https://www.relay.fm/analogue/178) Myke
announced he was launching a mentorship program. I was hesitant to sign up as
I've been podcasting for about 5 years now.

Here's something that I recently came to terms with thanks to a great
conversation with [Brian Douglas](https://twitter.com/bdougieyo).

### You need to let people help you.

Myke has a decade of experience in podcasting. Many of the people that I
interview on the show have been doing what they are doing professionally for
many years and have the experience of that journey to help them grow.

In my [interview with Tom Merritt](https://share.transistor.fm/s/671c723f), he
covers a secret to his success as a community builder and podcaster.

> I worked for a company called Tech TV back in the early two thousands, which had an incredible community. I saw how a good community works there and at CNet tried to take a lot of those lessons that I learned there and bring them to creating content there and then doing the same a twit with Leo Laporte, who is also masterful at managing a community. Ah, and then by the time I got to daily tech news show, I felt like I knew the things to do to make sure that you had a fun, healthy community that was beneficial not only for your show but for the people in it.

We could all follow the steps of Tom here and get a string of jobs where you learn from
years of experience or we can learn from their years of experience and shave
off incredible amounts of time.

I look forward to learning with and from all of the amazing people (all who are at
different places in their career).

Check out each of the members and their projects.
