description: I've made a simple change to my tech project's domain, and it saved me
  $35 a year. Here's why I did it.

This is a post mostly for archival purposes but today I renamed the diversityorgs project to Tech Diversity Orgs and moved the domain to <https://techdiversityorgs.com>. The reason why is simple, cost.

The _.tech_ domain is **$50** to renew and the _.com_ is **$15**. This doesn't seem like much in the grand scheme of things but you have to remember that TDO doesn't make money. This move **cuts the annual cost by about 40%**.

**Tally:**
- Server Fees: $60/year
- Domain: <strike>$50</strike> $15

I do see a couple opportunities to save but at the moment having a dedicated server makes this project a bit more _production-level_. In the future I could see parts of this project evolving over time.

Also you may find a bug or missed area. My bad just let me know on the [github repo](https://github.com/kjaymiller/diversity-orgs-tech) (still under the original project name)
