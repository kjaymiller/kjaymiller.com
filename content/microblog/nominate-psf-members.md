Dear PSF:

I feel like "Thank you for your submission" and a pre-canned message from a form response is a better user experience than this.

I definitely don't feel like I want to nominate more individuals from this response.

Maybe a form that you need to log in with your PSF membership account to access or something is a way to validate users.
