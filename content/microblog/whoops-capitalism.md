In conversation with PyTexas Foundation, I was inspired to the accidental capitalism conversation to make this sticker. Should I make an accidental capitalism in making these stickers and selling them on Etsy?

No the answer is always no, but I should make like 20 of these stickers and put them out at conferences.
