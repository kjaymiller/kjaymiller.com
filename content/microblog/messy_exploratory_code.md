RE: <https://fosstodon.org/@ehmatthes/113294437609860819>

[Eric](https://mastodon.social/@ehmatthes@fosstodon.org) I don't know if this was intentional but I am often discouraged when I have to write messy exploratory code.

I think it's based on live-coding sessions or coding interviews (I haven't had too many of those) I feel like I have to defend every decision I make or I'm a bad developer.

This has made me try to write the best most performant code possible.

Thank you for reminder that process doesn't have to be pristine and sometimes worrying about the wrong things can make it harder to get things right.
