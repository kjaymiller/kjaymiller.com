Trying out [ZenMode](ZenMode NVIM site:Github.com) and [Twilight](Twilight NVIM site:github.com) for my NVIM config. I'm not sure I can tell a difference.

When included with Twilight I think it is pretty nice for writing but I definitely like it with writing code as my eyes tend to wander around code a lot.
