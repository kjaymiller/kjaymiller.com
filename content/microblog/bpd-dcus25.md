I'm so dang proud of my leaders!

Thanks to the work from Tim Schilling, Ngazetungue Muheue, and others. We matched our fundraising from last year at DjangoCon US.

I don't think you understand how amazing that is. This year neither myself nor Lazouich Ford (our US Executor) were involved which meant they handled booth stuff, swag, messaging and donations.

This will be more and more important in the next years as we expand leadership and prepare for when our earliest leaders start to step down.

Great work team!
