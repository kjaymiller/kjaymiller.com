I hope folks in the US remember this #MemorialDay, Since 9/11 - more service members and veterans die by suicide than combat every year.

I'm a veteran and I struggle with depression and PTSD. I lost one of my brothers-in-arms and groomsmen to drug abuse and suicide. There isn't a week that goes by where I don't think of him; today I write this through tears of guilt.

Do the simple thing ask a service-member how they're doing and how is their mental health.
