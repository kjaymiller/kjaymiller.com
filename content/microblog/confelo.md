[@pashagolub](@PavloGolub@fosstodon.org) has made an interesting tool that uses the Elo system (yes from chess!) to help rate talks (for CFP Selection).

I made a fork of it because I would love to see this modified to fit a double-blind CFPs.

Happy for people to submit a PR on mine as I have some thoughts on how I would want to use this with tools like sessionize or pretalx eventually.

I also am not usually a conference organizer so I'm not the best person to offer much input.
