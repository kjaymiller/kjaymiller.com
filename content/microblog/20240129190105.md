I was able to get my first PyPI publishing workflow using the trusted publishers workflow really easy...

I'm a fan of good docs so I'll just share their link instead of creating another one.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-pypi

One minor thing I that got me is that your repo name is case-sensative so if you're having issues check repo casing.
