It's hard to get started but also walking a beginner through something can be a challenge.

This week I started the "Learn By Doing" series which follows the "Jay Teaches Better" streams with my friend Damien who wants to build a website.

We build a django site from nothing to a few routes in about 90 minutes and the hardest parts were truly:

- `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`
- explaining how routing works with url.py and app/url.py
