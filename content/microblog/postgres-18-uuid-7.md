Did you know that UUIDv7 is also supported by Python 3.14?

I along with my colleague Alexander Fridriksson are diving into some of the new features in #postgres18. We just released our look at UUIDv7.


UUIDv7 is almost a no brainer for new projects, simplifying indexing strategies and giving you a time-based organizing feature across multiple sources.

Stay tuned as there will be more to explore in PostgreSQL 18 and you can try it all out for free on the Aiven Platform.
