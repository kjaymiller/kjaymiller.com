Responding to Julius' post on [their challenges with visa policies](https://medium.com/@theflyboy/breaking-barriers-a-tech-speakers-plea-for-fair-visa-policies-621b5909e496)

I’ve been following Julius’ work not just in the BPD community.

America’s policies feel greedy. We talk about the expanding the American dream around the world. When people want to come over for a couple weeks to America to share skills and opportunities that make both parties better, we're like but you could give up all your progress in becoming a recognized leader in your own community and country to become an outlaw???

It makes no sense and even when we write letters and do everything we can to show how beneficial it would be to have them with us, it doesn't matter.

At the end of the day, those folks will share their knowledge with those in Europe and (LISTEN UP POLITICIANS) our _political adversaries_ like China. I know this because I'm **already** being asked to write letters of recommendations for people in Africa to learn and share their leadership skills in those areas already.

When we feel like we're being left behind on the global stage, this will be the reason why.
