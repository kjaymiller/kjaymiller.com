I was reminded by a friend of Kojo's keynote of PyGotham 2019 -

Been watching it this morning an was instantly reminded that communities out here always need help.

The likely first big help you can do is first and foremost be a friendly welcoming face in the community that works to make everyone who enters feel welcome.

Then it can expand to doing simple tasks with no need of writing code.

So take a look at your local community and see if you can offer a little bit of help.
