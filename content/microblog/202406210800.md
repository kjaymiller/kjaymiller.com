I've been trusting dependabot more and more and nore I'm using Anthony Shaw's (@tonybaloney@fosstodon.org) [Dependabot-bot](https://github.com/tonybaloney/dependabot-bot).

Of course I'm not suggesting that you blindly merge PRs but I'm also being honest that without maintainers, lots of folks are doing this anyway.

Also as a contingency I'm only autoapproving the updates from the main dependencies and not their dependencies.

Also not auto publishing releases and all releases are tested before a publish will go through.
