I recently added a [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) container and I'm happy about two things.

1. It's django behind the scenes (maybe I can tinker)

2. <https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/> created a [custom tiling css layout](https://brettterpstra.com/2024/11/18/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding/). It looks great!
