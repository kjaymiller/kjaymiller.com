Here's an update on my health.  It's short because I'm sleepy I may update more later.

## Physical Health

Pre-Diabetic!? ME!? OH NO....

On a diet (sips Pepsi), it's going as good as 2020 could make it. (No excuses I have been counting calories and trying to change my habits).

## Mental Health

Finally going to therapy. Only had one session so don't know anything yet.

## Professional Health

Work's good. I'm challenging myself and pushing our team to do new things. They like it. I like it sweet!
