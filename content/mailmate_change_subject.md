**DISCLAIMER: I'm not here to bash _Hey_. In fact I wouldn't have thought of this idea if
it weren't for them so great job!**

I was setting up my (Non-M1) mac mini to do some work and I needed to setup my
email system (currently [MailMate]). While doing this, I didn't have the "gmail" hotkeys enabled so I was trying to
figure out how to enter the search field when I hit ctrl+s and I got a very interesting window.

As mentioned earlier, this was a feature that _Hey_ was promoting as a feature.

Upon reading the _caveats_, I realized what MailMate was doing. Essentially it
was rewriting the mail with new headers (Which was why it was saying it would
appear as a new message in other clients.)

This made me realize that if this was that big of a deal you could simply forward the message to yourself with a
new subject... 

Sometimes the solution isn't elegant. Still it's a solution.
