title: I was on a Bullet Journal Roundtable
---

I was recently a guest on the Tekside Networks [GTD Jedi Podcast](https://www.tekside.net/gtdjedi) with my [TekTok](https://www.tekside.net/tektok) cohosts Clay and Colin for a roundtable covering bullet journaling.

I was happy to meet fellow BuJo User [Laura Broder](https://www.instagram.com/laurabroder/?hl=en). We seem like two folks cut from a very similar cloth.

I'm seeing more people investing in hybridism and the overall feeling that analog bullet journaling doesn't seem to fit in many folks digital workflow.

In my tribe I feel like a loner as most folks feel they need new tricks and tools to make bullet journaling work. That said I feel like there is still a (decreasing) audience for folks that need to keep their life and productivity contained in a notebook.
