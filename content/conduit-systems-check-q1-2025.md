Unfortunately we had several things get in the way this quarter so we did a mini systems-check in our post show. If you want to get second topics with each conduit become a member of [Conduit](https://relay.fm/conduit).

This transcription was generated how [I transcribe all episodes](https://github.com/kjaymiller/conduit-transcripts)(Generated with whisper and not updated for correctness - though I will accept PRs to correct them).

I then used Claude 3.5 sonnet passing in the portion of the transcription concerning the mini-systems-check.

### Kathy's Mini Update

- Kathy still uses OmniFocus for personal task management and her notebook for bullet journaling
- She's using her Sidekick notepad less because it gets bent when her arms hit it.

### My (much longer) Update

I mentioned that Robb Knight (former guest) started bullet journaling recently and talked about that on some episodes of Ruminate.

I send Robb live reactions to his podcast [_Ruminate_](https://ruminatepodcast.com/) episodes. I also do this with Brett and Jeff from time-to-time with [Overtired](https://overtiredpod.com/)

I'm using my Hobonichi planner (the "day free" cousin version) more consistently this year. I'm concerned about running out of space since I've already used a third of it, averaging 1-2 pages per day. I'll likely get a second one halfway through the year or get one of the [half-year jawns](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2025/pc/detail_cover/ob25_avec/).

As far as apps go I'm using discusses "- Up Ahead (for countdowns/reminders) and Reader (by Silvio Rizzi).

I mentioned this in [a microblog post](https://kjaymiller.com/microblog/202502060017.html), I tried to import 400+ podcast subscriptions into Reader, causing the app to crash. He reduced it to 250, then 100, but still had issues.

Normally, we do our systems-check on the 2nd episode of the 2nd month of each quarter.

I hope you can catch our normal episodes every two weeks on Thursday.
