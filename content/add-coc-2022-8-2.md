The first update to my VS Code extension [Add Code of Conduct][Add Code of Conduct] is now available!

In this update, we added the ability to choose between two commonly used Codes of Conduct:

- [Contributor Covenant][Contributor Covenant] (The existing Option) 
- [Citizen Code of Conduct][Citizen Code of Conduct] (The new Option)

This opens the door to adding several options.

This also begins the conversation around what other files should be added by default and how to add them. Speaking with my wonderful colleage, [Sarah](https://twitter.com/crazy4pi314), I feel the right thing to do is to replicat this process for all of the files I think should be a standard in [making open source accessible to everyone](https://contributionswelcome.org).

That said, this extension will only handle code of conducts but there is still much to be done, like adding more options and providing a way to add defaults.

I give a few shoutouts on the [changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/kjaymiller.vscode-add-code-of-conduct/changelog) so check that out.
