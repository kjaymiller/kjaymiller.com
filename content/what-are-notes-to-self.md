I started wanting to ingest more and more content for AI (because I do like using it to learn things from and about myself).

One of the things I mentioned during my talk at PGDay Chi was that I wanted to start storing more and more information.

That's why I'm creating the [_Notes to Self_](/notes/) posts. This is similar to [Simon Willison's _today I learned_](https://til.simonwillison.net/).

My goal is to keep track of things that I'm learning and doing. The [first _NTS_](/notes/21-may-2025-print-list.html) actually came up because I used a different 3d print-file that I couldn't find after digging for a while. This actually would have been a great question to search for like "What was the backpack hangar that I've been using?".
