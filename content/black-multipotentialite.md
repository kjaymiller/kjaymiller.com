Some of us are born knowing what we will do. I have worked for family-owned companies where the son grew up in the warehouse learning what he could so that one day he would run the show.

For many of us, the only family legacy is filled with gang involvement, drug dealing, and a life of violence.

For me, it was a legacy of the military, but that was still something that I was not sold on. My military career came from being tired of living in self-placed poverty and the desire not to return to college. Still, my father was in the Army, my grandfather was in the Army, so I did what any respectable young man with a history of Army veterans would do.

I joined the Marine Corps.

### But Why

> For what is a man, what has he got?

> If not himself, then he has naught

> To say the things he truly feels

> And not the words of one who kneels

> The record shows, I took the blows

> And did it my way - My Way, Frank Sinatra

I have never wanted to do a thing because that is how it's been done. I've never wanted to walk the path that was paved for me.

In my opinion, being told, "I can't" is the biggest motivator.

When I was getting out of the military, I was told, I'd never find a job (I got one). When I married young I was told I'd regret it (No Regrets).

In my first job, I was told to devote all my energy to the job... NO.

### I do a lot.

* I work a Day job.
* I manage a [side business](https://productivityintech.com) helping people in tech with Marketing and Digital Content Production.
* I [write code](https://github.com/kjaymiller).
* I host a range of [podcasts](/projects) from tech to gaming.
* I'm a member of an Esports organization and [stream regularly](https://twitch.tv/kjaymiller).

My _coding_ skills help me **automate** and **optimize** my day job.

My _day job_ skills, challenge me to **think differently** and **shake up stale thought**.

My _podcasting_ and _streaming_ skills gave me the ability to identify ways that **I could help my
side-business clients** in **their** content-creating journey.

They may not seem connected at first, but it is ALL the things I do that
qualifies me to do what I do, how I do it.

I know it's a lot, but the people that inspired me, are the people that made careers doing the things they enjoyed and finding ways to connect the dots.

Donald Glover became one of the most influential black artists in America by combining his ability to act with an ability to direct and create amazing and thoughtful music.

Janelle Monae has done something similar by not just making music but making a statement in her sound, and videos. Her message made her a clear choice for portraying one of Black America's most notable mathematicians, Mary Jackson.

My child will grow up seeing me doing what I want and enjoying it, and maybe I will inspire her to do the same.
