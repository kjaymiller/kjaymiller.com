# Support Your Python Journey with Python High Five: A 10-Week Course

We’re thrilled to announce a partnership with [Python High Five](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/), a comprehensive 10-week Python course starting in early September. This course is designed to help you take your Python skills to the next level through a structured, hands-on learning experience.

### Why Python High Five?

Python High Five is more than just a course; it’s an opportunity to deepen your understanding of Python, whether you're new to the language or looking to refine your existing skills. Over the span of 10 weeks, you'll engage in practical exercises that challenge you to think critically and code efficiently, all while gaining a solid grasp of Python’s core concepts.

This course is perfect for anyone who’s serious about improving their Python skills and wants to do so in a supportive, interactive environment.

### A Partnership That Gives Back

We believe in supporting our community, and that's why we’re excited about this partnership. Python High Five is a paid course, but thanks to our collaboration, we’re able to offer you a special discount. Not only will you receive a discount on the course, but for each use of the discount code, Python High Five will also donate a portion of the proceeds to our community.

Specifically, when you use the discount code "BlackPythonDevs," you’ll get $30 off the course fee, and Python High Five will donate $70 to support our community initiatives. This way, you’re not only investing in your own education, but you’re also contributing to the growth and development of our community.

### Why This Matters

We’re always looking for ways to bring valuable resources to our members, and Python High Five is one such opportunity. By enrolling in this course, you’re not just gaining new skills; you’re also helping to sustain and support the resources and opportunities that our community provides. Your participation helps us continue to offer programming, workshops, and other events that benefit everyone.
